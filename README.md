# Ownership-in-Rust
Implementation of ownership in Rust lang

This project helps beginners to understand the concept of ownership in rust language using comprehensive explanations and examples. 
Certain concepts like REFERENCES and SLICE TYPES are also included in this project. Users can clone this repo and try out this program on their own to get
a grasp on these concepts

Also to take into account, I am a beginner myself and any corrections in the source code or otherwise would be HUGELY appreciated!

Happy Coding!
